                <p>In transcribing Emily Hobhouse's 1905 journal, I have maintained the form and content of the original text as much as possible. 
                    Original spellings and punctuation are retained, as are the author's deletions - denoted by a <unclear>stroke through the passage</unclear> - and additions - enclosed by <add>angle brackets</add>. Only in places where this may cause 
                   confusion have I made editorial additions - enclosed by <supplied>square brackets</supplied>. Capitalisations have been standardised throughout, due to Hobhouse's somewhat erratic handwriting, 
                   and unclear words are followed by a question mark in square brackets - [?].

                that it was New Year's day, succeeding<lb/> pretty well in this. I would not go<lb/>
                to Church for fear of being reminded<lb/> of the fact so I took Meg for a walk<lb/>
                in Hyde Park with her new collar on.<lb/> I was careful not to wish <persName
                    ref="#maryhobhouse">Aunt<lb/> Mary</persName> a "happy New Year" but she<lb/>
                was equally careful, rather formally<lb/> to wish me every kind of happiness<lb/> of
                prosperity in my coming work.<lb/> Wishes for my personal happiness<lb/> always fall
                hollow on my ears.</p>
            <p><lb/> I began the day by writing to <persName ref="#charlesscott">Mr.
                    Scott</persName><lb/> asking him if he would employ<lb/> me as paid
                correspondent for<lb/> the Manchester Guardian in S. Africa<lb/> - my first attempt
                at earning<lb/> my living. I realize that standing<lb/> as I now do, wholly on my
                own<lb/> legs, &amp; that too in a far &amp; costly<lb/> land, I <hi
                    rend="underline">must</hi> add to my income<lb/> at least £100 a year. Failing<lb/>

                this, I have no hope of even an<lb/> occasional visit
                to England.<lb/> If he refuses, I shall not know<lb/> where to turn. Having
                always<lb/> done voluntary &amp; unpaid work<lb/> all my life, it was a very
                hard<lb/> letter to write. I realize now to<lb/> the full how ill-advised it is
                for<lb/> solitary women to work, as since<lb/> youth I have always worked -<lb/> for
                others, spending thus my entire<lb/> time &amp; strength, so that I have<lb/> never
                qualified myself to <hi rend="underline">earn</hi><lb/> a <hi rend="underline"
                    >living</hi>. I hold it is every<lb/> woman's duty to provide for herself<lb/>
                first, gaining a home &amp; a footing<lb/> &amp; <hi rend="underline">then</hi> she
                is at liberty to spend<lb/> &amp; be spent for her family &amp; the<lb/> world at
                large.<lb/></p>

work of correspondence &amp; the<lb/>

in reply to me<supplied>,</supplied> I had ventured to<lb/>

write to him thanking &amp; congratulating<lb/>

him for his beautiful new collection<lb/>

such as his come now &amp; again &amp;<lb/>

be preserved. I shall put his<lb/>

in my large album of addresses<lb/>

I floated all day; at 5'oclock<lb/>

came Dr. Bisschop to help me with<lb/>

my difficulties concerning Mr. Celliers<lb/>

&amp; the translation. He condemned<lb/>

it utterly, and strongly deprecated<lb/>

publication. He took away again<lb/>

keep till it should seem advisable<lb/>

to publish it.<lb/></p></div>

I started early to go round by Linden<lb/>

to pack up her Aunt's belongings.<lb/>

Mrs. Bradby in her own sweet way<lb/>

spoke about her promised loan of<lb/>

                of hers must be looked<lb/> on as an oracle, even if on the<lb/> commonest subject.
                She has<lb/> no lighteners of conversation and<lb/> seeks to impress every

                cannot tell if<lb/> the knee cap can then be used as<lb/> hard as will be required.
                I shall<lb/> have to wait and take Dr. Murray's<lb/> opinion in Cape Town. We are

                impressed with his<lb/> courage &amp; hope for the future of<lb/> the country. He
                said he thought<lb/> the future held more hope than<lb/> before the war. The people
